    create a basic website, styled with CSS.
    Include a title, and one button that says
    "Download Resource Zip". When the button is
    clicked, the user should be prompted for a password (iCode002).
    
    If the password is correct, the user should be redirected to an
    AWS S3 link that will start the download.

    If the password is incorrect, the user should be alerted that
    the password is incorrect.

    The AWS link hasn't been created yet, but it will be similar to:
    https://icode-files.s3.amazonaws.com/resources2023.zip

-->

#Make sure that everything is centered and Helvetica Neue is used for the font.
